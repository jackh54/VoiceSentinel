VoiceSentinel is a comprehensive real-time voice moderation system for Minecraft servers using Simple Voice Chat. It combines a Java-based Minecraft plugin with a Python backend processor to provide advanced speech-to-text transcription and content filtering capabilities.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** VoiceSentinel setup requires basic knowledge of Linux and Docker. If you are new to these technologies, we recommend seeking assistance from someone experienced before continuing. For installation support, join my Discord. (link at the bottom).

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time voice transcription** using OpenAI Whisper models
- **Advanced profanity detection** with customizable word lists and pattern matching
- **Configurable audio processing** with chunk size, sample rate, and duration limits
- **Rate limiting and API key authentication** for secure integration
- **Queue-based processing** for handling high-volume voice chat
- **Comprehensive logging and monitoring** for server administration

### Technical Features
- **Asynchronous processing** with background workers
- **Docker support** for easy deployment
- **CPU-optimized** for cost-effective hosting
- **REST API** for integration with other services
- **File-based result delivery** for reliable communication
- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files and processed results
- **Health monitoring** and system statistics

### Minecraft Integration
- **Folia & Paper compatibility** for modern server software, might work for bukkit/spigot, but who cares about those anymore?
- **Simple Voice Chat integration** for seamless voice capture

## üìã Requirements

### Server Requirements
- **Java 17+** for the Minecraft plugin
- **Python 3.8+** for the backend processor
- **Minecraft 1.21+** Folia or Paper
- **Simple Voice Chat** plugin installed
- **Minimum 4GB RAM** (8GB+ recommended)
- **Multi-core CPU** for optimal processing

### Dependencies
- **Backend Processor**: FastAPI, Whisper, PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy

> **Using Docker is recommended to run the backend processor, as it installs this for you.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository, it is recommended to download the latest release though.
git clone https://github.com/jackh54/VoiceSentinel.git
cd VoiceSentinel/processor-voicesentinel

# Copy and edit the configuration file
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your settings

# Start the backend processor in the background using Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# To view logs or check status:
docker compose logs -f
docker compose ps

# To stop the processor:
docker compose down
```

### 2. Plugin Installation

Install and configure the plugin as described in the plugin's documentation. Make sure to set the same server-key in both the processor & plugin configuration

### 3. Configuration

Configure the backend using `config.json` (see below). For plugin configuration, refer to the plugin's own documentation.

#### Sample Backend Configuration (`config.json`)
```json

  }
} 
```

### Production Deployment

1. **Use a reverse proxy** (nginx/Apache) for SSL termination
2. **Implement backup strategies** for configuration and logs (*optional*)

### Performance Tuning

- **Adjust worker count** based on CPU cores
- **Optimize queue sizes** for your server load
- **Configure memory limits** for audio processing
- **Use appropriate Whisper models** (tiny/base/small/medium/large)
- **Monitor processing times** and adjust timeouts

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

VoiceSentinel includes comprehensive security features:

- **API key authentication** for all endpoints
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Secure file handling** with automatic cleanup
- **CORS configuration** for web integration
- **Trusted host middleware** for production deployments

For security vulnerabilities, please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).
